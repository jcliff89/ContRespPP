## Resubmission
This is a resubmission based on previous feedback. In this version I have:

  * Omitted "An implementation of" from the beginning of the description text.  
  * Added \value Rd-tags for ContRespPP S3 print and summary methods.  
  * Added verbose argument to allow console status printing suppression.  
  * Altering vignette and associated doc files to revert to previous user options that were updated.


## Test environments
* local R installation, R 4.1.0
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.1.0
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* This is a new release.
